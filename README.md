# 🎨 CSS Learning Journey

Welcome, reader!  
This repository contains the lessons and practice files I completed while learning **CSS**. CSS was the next step in my programming journey after HTML, and it allowed me to style webpages, create layouts, and bring designs to life.

## 📚 How I Learned CSS
I started learning CSS to make my webpages visually appealing. I explored online resources — websites, documentation, and YouTube tutorials — some in **Somali** and some in **English**.  
Applying CSS to my HTML pages and seeing immediate changes made the learning process fun and encouraged me to keep improving.

## 🎯 My Career Path
I am currently focused on:
- **First stop:** Frontend development  
- **Next stop:** Becoming a Full-Stack Developer  

CSS gave me the skills to design attractive and responsive web pages. It also prepared me for integrating JavaScript to make interactive web applications.

## ✨ Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as:
- A record of the CSS concepts I’ve learned  
- A showcase of my progress in styling webpages  
- A foundation for my future studies in full-stack web development
